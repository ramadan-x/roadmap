### **Foundational Level: Programming, OOP, DSA (6-12 Months)**

This initial phase is crucial. It's like building the foundation of a house; skipping it will lead to instability.

1. \[ \] **Programming Languages** *(e.g., Rust, C++, C\#, Java, Python)*  
   * \[ \] **Structured Programming**  
     * \[ \] Data Types  
     * \[ \] Variables  
     * \[ \] Conditional Statements (if, switch)  
     * \[ \] Looping Constructs (for, while)  
     * \[ \] Functions  
     * \[ \] Struct  
   * \[ \] **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Paradigm**  
     * \[ \] Inheritance  
     * \[ \] Encapsulation  
     * \[ \] Abstraction  
     * \[ \] Polymorphism  
2. \[ \] **Data Structures**  
   * \[ \] **Linear**  
     * \[ \] Array, Dynamic Array  
     * \[ \] Linked List  
     * \[ \] Stack  
     * \[ \] Queue  
   * \[ \] **Non-Linear**  
     * \[ \] Tree (Binary Search Tree)  
     * \[ \] Dictionary (Set, Hash Table)  
     * \[ \] Graph  
3. \[ \] **Algorithms**  
   * \[ \] **Searching**  
     * \[ \] Binary Search  
     * \[ \] Linear Search  
   * \[ \] **Sorting**  
     * \[ \] Bubble Sort  
     * \[ \] Quick Sort  
     * \[ \] Merge Sort  
   * \[ \] **Graph Traversal**  
     * \[ \] BFS (Breadth-First Search)  
     * \[ \] DFS (Depth-First Search)  
   * \[ \] Backtracking and Recursion  
   * \[ \] Dynamic Programming  
4. \[ \] **Problem Solving (on LeetCode/HackerRank)**  
   * \[ \] Easy: 50-100 problems  
   * \[ \] Medium: 15-40 problems  
5. \[ \] **Projects**  
   * \[ \] Small project to apply what you learned (e.g., management system like pharmacy, HR, school administration, or games like Snake, Pong).

*This phase should take approximately 6-12 months.*

### **Second Foundational Level (Ideal Path): Core Computer Science Principles**

These can be studied in parallel and don't always require immediate practical application. Check Berkeley's Roadmap for potential subjects.

* \[ \] Operating Systems  
* \[ \] Databases  
* \[ \] Networking  
* \[ \] Software Engineering (e.g., Agile)

### **Third Foundational Level: Track/Domain Fundamentals**

Understanding the core principles of your chosen area (e.g., web, mobile, game development). Check crash courses for introductions.

### **Fourth Foundational Level: Track/Technology**

Choosing specific technologies within your domain based on interest and domain fundamentals, (e.g., .Net, Flutter, Nodejs). not just popularity. Check crash courses.

### **Entering the Job Market**

* Build a strong portfolio to showcase your work.  
* Focus on practical experience through internships and personal projects.  
* Prepare for interviews and demonstrate practical understanding.  
* Continuous learning is essential in the tech field.  
* Passion and a strong foundation are more critical than following trends.

### **Different Situations**

* **Complete:** Study all four levels for a robust and adaptable career.  
* **Quick Job:** Focus on the first foundational level and then technology/domain. *It's very important to return to the second and third levels after getting a job.*
