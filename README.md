# **Roadmap**

## **Foundational Level 1: Programming, OOP, & DSA (6-12 Months)**

This initial phase is crucial. It's like building the foundation of a house; skipping it will lead to instability later on.

**Programming Languages** _(e.g., Rust, C++, C#, Java, Python)_

- **Structured Programming**
    - [ ] Data Types
    - [ ] Variables
    - [ ] Operators
    - [ ] Conditional Statements (if, switch)
    - [ ] Looping Constructs (for, while)
    - [ ] Functions
    - [ ] Structs
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Paradigm**
    - [ ] Inheritance
    - [ ] Encapsulation
    - [ ] Abstraction
    - [ ] Polymorphism

**Data Structures**

- **Linear**
    - [ ] Array, Dynamic Array
    - [ ] Linked List
    - [ ] Stack
    - [ ] Queue
- **Non-Linear**
    - [ ] Tree (specifically Binary Search Tree)
    - [ ] Dictionary (Set, Hash Table)
    - [ ] Graph

**Algorithms**

- **Searching**
    - [ ] Binary Search
    - [ ] Linear Search
- **Sorting**
    - [ ] Bubble Sort
    - [ ] Quick Sort
    - [ ] Merge Sort
- **Graph Traversal**
    - [ ] BFS (Breadth-First Search)
    - [ ] DFS (Depth-First Search)
- **Other Techniques**
    - [ ] Backtracking and Recursion
    - [ ] Greedy Algorithms
    - [ ] Dynamic Programming

**Problem Solving** _(on platforms like LeetCode/HackerRank)_

- [ ] Easy: 50-100 problems
- [ ] Medium: 15-40 problems

**Projects**

- [ ] Build a small project to apply what you've learned (e.g., a management system for a pharmacy, HR, or school, or games like Snake and Pong).

_This entire phase should take approximately **6-12 months** to complete thoroughly._

## **Foundational Level 2 (Ideal Path): Core CS Principles**

These subjects can be studied in parallel and don't always require immediate practical application. For guidance, check university course maps, such as the [CS Course Map Guides from UC Berkeley](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/courseguides).

- [ ] Operating Systems
- [ ] Databases
- [ ] Networking
- [ ] Software Engineering (e.g., Agile methodologies)

---

## **Foundational Level 3: Track/Domain Fundamentals**

Focus on understanding the core principles of your chosen specialization (e.g., web, mobile, game development). Crash courses are a great way to get an introduction to a domain.

---

## **Foundational Level 4: Track/Technology**

Choose specific technologies within your domain (e.g., .NET, Flutter, Node.js). This choice should be based on your domain's fundamentals and personal interest, not just on current popularity.

---

## **Entering the Job Market**

- Build a **strong portfolio** to showcase your work.
- Focus on gaining practical experience through **internships and personal projects**.
- Prepare for interviews by practicing and demonstrating your **practical understanding**.
- Remember that **continuous learning** is essential in the tech field.
- Your **passion and a strong foundation** are more critical than chasing trends.

## **Different Learning Paths**

- **Perfect Path**: Study all four foundational levels for a robust and adaptable career. This is the ideal approach for long-term success.
- **Quick Path**: Focus on the **first foundational level** and then jump to a specific **technology/domain**. _It is crucial to return to the second and third levels after securing a job to build a stronger career foundation._
